Early ciphers shifted
letters of the alphabet
by set amounts
Eg: H would become T (12 is the key)

Codemoji shifts
letter too,
and replaces them with emoji !

Just write a message
you want to turn
into emoji

Pick an emoji and Codemoji
will use it in a unique formula
to scramble your message

Share your emoji
message with you
friends and let them
try to unscramble it

"Ciphers are math at work"

Remember to send
your friends hints
about which emoji you used.
Otherwise they won't be able
to read your message !

Codemoji is a fun way
for you and your friends
to learn about ciphers

You shouldn't use it for
secure communications, though.
Thankfully, modern encryption tools
are way stronger than emojis
